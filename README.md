# BChecksFTW
BChecksFTW is a publicly curated list of all BCheck rules available over the internet.

## BCheck Rules
BChecks are custom scan checks that you can create and import. Burp Scanner runs these checks in addition to its built-in scanning routine, helping you to target your scans and make your testing workflow as efficient as possible.

Each BCheck is defined as a plain text file with a .bcheck file extension. These files use a custom definition language to specify the behavior of the check.
